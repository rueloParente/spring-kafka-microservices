# Stage 2

## 1. Setting up the library service
Now that we have our root project set up, we can start creating the first service of our project.
This service will be responsible for managing the library's books and persist them in a SQL Server database.

We will be using mariadb as the database, and we will be using the Spring Boot framework to create the service.

### 1.1. Create the library service using spring initializer
We will be working with the following dependencies:


### Dependencies
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.mariadb.jdbc</groupId>
        <artifactId>mariadb-java-client</artifactId>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Breakdown of Dependencies:

1. **spring-boot-starter-data-jpa**
    - **Purpose**: Provides the Spring Data JPA framework, which simplifies database access and object-relational mapping (ORM). It helps manage entities and provides an abstraction layer for database interactions.
    - **Usage**: To interact with a relational database, making CRUD operations easier.

2. **spring-boot-starter-web**
    - **Purpose**: This includes everything needed to build web applications, including RESTful services. It's a starter dependency that pulls in components such as Spring MVC, embedded Tomcat, and JSON converters (like Jackson).
    - **Usage**: For creating REST controller, web services and web-based applications with Spring Boot.

3. **mariadb-java-client**
    - **Purpose**: This is the JDBC driver for MariaDB, which allows the application to connect to a MariaDB database.
    - **Usage**: Needed to access a MariaDB database at runtime.

4. **spring-boot-starter-test**
    - **Purpose**: This dependency brings in the necessary libraries for testing Spring applications, including JUnit, Mockito, and Springâ€™s test support utilities.
    - **Scope**: With a `<scope>` of `test`, this library is only necessary when testing the application and is not included in the final build.
    - **Usage**: Facilitates writing unit tests and integration tests for the application.

### Build Section
```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

#### Breakdown of the Build Section:

- **spring-boot-maven-plugin**
    - **Purpose**: This plugin is essential for building Spring Boot applications. It provides capabilities for packaging the application into a standalone executable JAR (or WAR) file, which can be easily run without needing a separate server.
    - **Features**:
        - Creates a runnable JAR that includes all the dependencies required to run the application.
        - It can also be used to run the application directly from the command line using Maven, simplifying development.
        - Supports configuration for additional features like custom main classes, resource filtering, and more.
